"""
Great job! There are two kinds of errors in Python - syntax errors and exceptions. Syntax errors occur when you don't use correct syntax and Python doesn't know how to run your code. Exceptions occur when Python runs into unexpected situations while executing your code and can happen even if you used correct syntax.
